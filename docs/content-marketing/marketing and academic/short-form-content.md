### 1. Problem Statement Thread

🧵 **Thread starter:**
"Claude Code uses `.claude/` with markdown. Cursor uses `.cursor/rules/` with YAML. Windsurf uses `.windsurf/` with XML. GitHub Copilot uses `.github/copilot/` with JSON.

We have an AI assistant configuration fragmentation problem. (1/7)"

**Follow-up tweets:**

- "Each platform reinventing the wheel. Developers learning 4+ different config formats for the same context. Context drift as configs diverge. High switching costs between AI tools." (2/7)

- "While building VDK, we solved this by creating a universal schema that works everywhere. One definition → deploys to all platforms. We're open-sourcing this as the standard." (3/7)

- "Now we're launching AI Context Schema as the universal standard for AI assistant configuration. Think JSON Schema, but for AI context." (4/7)

- "Why this matters: AI coding tools are proliferating faster than standards. Every new tool creates more fragmentation. We need universal interoperability." (5/7)

- "The schema handles platform differences intelligently. Cursor gets file patterns, Windsurf respects character limits, Claude gets slash commands. Same intent, platform-optimized output." (6/7)

- "Repository: <https://github.com/ai-context-schema/ai-context-schema>
VDK (reference implementation): <https://vdk.tools>
Time to standardize AI context. 🚀" (7/7)

### 2. Technical Achievement Post

"🎯 Launching: Universal AI assistant configuration

✅ One schema works across Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot
✅ Platform adapters handle format differences automatically  
✅ Full validation and compatibility checking built-in
✅ Reference implementation through VDK

We're open-sourcing the solution to AI configuration fragmentation."

### 3. Developer Pain Point

"Tired of maintaining separate configs for every AI coding assistant?

`.claude/CLAUDE.md`
`.cursor/rules/pattern.mdc`
`.windsurf/rules/context.xml`
`.github/copilot/guidelines.json`

There's a better way: AI Context Schema

Define once. Deploy everywhere. 🎯"

### 4. Industry Perspective  

"Every platform thinking they need their own AI context format is like every browser implementing their own JavaScript.

We know how this story ends: universal standards win.

AI Context Schema is that standard. VDK proves it works at scale."

### 5. Call to Action

"Looking for AI tool builders and developer advocates:

We need platform adapters for VS Code, IntelliJ, Vim, and more emerging AI coding tools.

### 1. Engineering Leadership Focus

**"The Hidden Cost of AI Assistant Fragmentation"**

As AI coding assistants become standard in development teams, we're facing a new infrastructure challenge: configuration fragmentation.

Every AI platform has its own format:
• Claude Code: Markdown memory files
• Cursor: YAML-frontmatter MDC files  
• Windsurf: XML memory with character limits
• GitHub Copilot: JSON guidelines

**The business impact:**

- Increased onboarding time for new developers
- Context drift as configurations diverge
- Vendor lock-in reducing tool experimentation
- Higher maintenance overhead

At VDK, we solved this with AI Context Schema - a universal format that deploys to any platform. Our 109+ production schemas prove it scales.

**The result:** 90% reduction in configuration overhead, seamless tool switching, and faster developer onboarding.

This is why standardization matters in emerging technology categories.

### 2. Technical Innovation Focus

**"From Fragmentation to Standardization: Building AI Context Schema"**

While building VDK (Vibe Development Kit), we encountered a frustrating problem: every AI coding assistant used a different configuration format.

The technical challenge was creating a universal schema that:
✓ Preserves behavioral intent across platforms
✓ Handles platform-specific limitations gracefully  
✓ Supports dependency resolution and conflict detection
✓ Enables automated validation and compatibility checking

The solution: AI Context Schema - a JSON Schema-based specification with intelligent platform adapters.

**Key innovations:**

- Platform abstraction layer preserving AI behavior intent
- Automatic adaptation to character limits, file patterns, and format requirements
- Relationship graph for schema dependencies and conflicts
- Comprehensive validation pipeline

We're open-sourcing this as an industry standard. The fragmentation problem is solved - now we need ecosystem adoption.

**Title: "AI Context Schema: Universal standard for AI assistant configuration"**

**Problem:** Every AI coding assistant uses different config formats:

- Claude Code: `.claude/` markdown files
- Cursor: `.cursor/rules/` YAML+markdown  
- Windsurf: `.windsurf/rules/` XML format
- GitHub Copilot: `.github/copilot/` JSON

This creates fragmentation, vendor lock-in, and maintenance overhead.

**Solution:** AI Context Schema - define once, deploy everywhere.

```yaml
---
id: "react-patterns"
platforms:
  claude-code: { memory: true, command: true }
  cursor: { globs: ["**/*.tsx"], activation: "auto" }
  windsurf: { mode: "workspace" }
  github-copilot: { priority: 8 }
---
# React Development Patterns

```

**Status:** 109+ production schemas, reference implementation (VDK), full validation tools.

We're open-sourcing this because fragmentation hurts everyone. Standards enable innovation.

Thoughts on AI tool standardization?

### 2. r/devtools  

**Title: "Show /r/devtools: Universal AI assistant configuration schema"**

Built this while solving configuration fragmentation for our AI coding tools.

**What it does:**

- Single schema format that works across Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot
- Platform adapters handle format differences automatically
- Validation and compatibility checking built-in
- 109+ working schemas prove it scales

**Why it matters:**
AI coding assistants are becoming essential, but each has different config formats. This creates vendor lock-in and maintenance overhead.

**Demo:** <https://github.com/ai-context-schema/ai-context-schema>

The reference implementation (VDK) shows this working in production. Now open-sourcing as a standard.

Feedback welcome - especially from maintainers of AI coding tools!

**Title: "Show HN: AI Context Schema – Universal standard for AI assistant configuration"**

**Body:**
While building VDK (<https://vdk.tools>), we hit a frustrating problem: every AI coding assistant has its own configuration format.

Claude Code uses markdown memory files. Cursor uses YAML+markdown. Windsurf uses XML. GitHub Copilot uses JSON. Same purpose, completely different formats.

This creates fragmentation, vendor lock-in, and maintenance overhead for development teams.

AI Context Schema solves this with a universal format that deploys to any platform. Platform adapters handle the format differences automatically while preserving behavioral intent.

**Working proof:** 109+ production schemas across 4 major platforms
**Reference implementation:** VDK CLI with full ecosystem
**Validation:** Complete schema validation and compatibility checking

Repository: <https://github.com/ai-context-schema/ai-context-schema>

This feels like the JSON Schema moment for AI context definition. Standards enable ecosystem growth.

Looking for feedback from AI tool maintainers and developers dealing with configuration fragmentation.

### 2. Technical Discussion Format  

**Title: "AI assistant configuration fragmentation and the path to standardization"**

**Body:**
Interesting technical challenge we solved while building VDK: how do you create a universal configuration format for AI coding assistants when every platform has different requirements?

**Constraints:**

- Cursor needs file pattern matching (globs)
- Windsurf has 6K character limits  
- Claude Code supports slash commands
- GitHub Copilot has priority systems
- New platforms launching monthly

**Solution approach:**

1. Universal schema with platform-specific adapters
2. Behavioral intent preservation across format translation
3. Dependency resolution and conflict detection
4. Automated validation and compatibility checking

**Results:** 109+ working schemas across 4 platforms, proving the approach scales.

Open-sourcing this as AI Context Schema because fragmentation hurts ecosystem growth.
